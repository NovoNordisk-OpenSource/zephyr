Hereâ€™s a good template for README:
1) A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.
2) An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.
3) Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.
4) An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details. This is also a good place to describe how your package fits into the ecosystem of its target domain.



This package has tools for developers of other R packages, writing messages based on options set in the developer's package. The package assumes that options are set using the `options` package.
