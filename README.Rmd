This package is a template for future R packages developed by the ATMOS team.

The template sets branch policies, package development standards, and GitHub action workflows.
For details see below:

To create a new package you have two options:

1. Press "Use this template" to create a new repository based on this template. Settings are not copied, and have to be manually set or set using the following functions from your editor:

    1. `use_atmos_rulesets()`: Copies rule sets for branch protection etc.
    1. `use_atmos_pages()`: Enables GitHub pages
    1. `use_atmos_settings()`: Copies general settings

1. Use the R function `create_atmos_package()` from your editor to create a new repository based on this template. By default this also sets all settings to be equal to the settings applied to this template repository.

## Branch policies

The following applies to the `main` branch:

- Requires a pull request before merging
- Pull requests has to be approved by 2 reviewers
- Pull requests has to be reviewed by at least one code owner
- All conversations on code must be resolved before a pull request can be merged
- When merging pull requests only merge and squash commits are enabled
- TODO: Requirement of linked issues

## Standards

- Set licence to Apache licence version 2.0 with Novo Nordisk A/S as the copyright holder. Check that year is correct!
- Use a README.Rmd
- Use `testthat` for testing
- Use `pkgdown` to create a documentation webpage
- Setup `lintr` with default style

## GitHub actions

- Checks:
  - styling: MegaLinter (calls `lintr` for R scripts)
  - updated documentation
  - updated README
- R CMD Check
- Test coverage
- Pkgdown webpage hosted on GitHub pages. Pags for pull requests are also hosted under "base-url/dev/PR-number".
- Upon creation a pull request is created with all package specific files updated to use the new package name.

## Design (todo)

- Some great design guide to be followed and include some awesome CSS
